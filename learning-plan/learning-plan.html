        <h2>My learning Plan</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>My long-term goal is to become a senior software engineer specialising in machine learning and AI development. I have a strong interest in programming and have decided to pursue this passion through a bootcamp program. My plan is to use my skills as a developer to access more opportunities in the industry and gain experience working with machine learning and AI. While I have a specific career path in mind, I am open to exploring different opportunities and pathways that could help me achieve my long-term goals.

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>My strengths for Bootcamp include being a fast learner and creative problem solver. However, I struggle with time management and may not always ask for help when needed. Additionally, English is not my first language, which may affect my efficiency. To address these limitations, I plan to set clear goals, use time-tracking tools, and take advantage of available resources. I'm actively working on improving my language skills to ensure that language barriers don't hold me back. Overall, I'm confident that my strengths will serve me well in Bootcamp and that I can overcome my limitations with determination and hard work.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>I anticipate that my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be time management, staying focused, and presenting in front of the group. While I'm confident in my technical abilities, I sometimes struggle with prioritizing my time and staying on task, especially when there are distractions.Additionally, presenting in front of the group can be nerve-wracking for me, as I'm not always confident speaking in public. However, I recognize that effective communication is essential in a team-based environment, and I'm committed to improving my presentation skills.</p>

        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>As a Bootcamp student, I understand the importance of developing non-technical or human skills, such as effective teamwork and soft skills. I plan to focus on improving these skills during my time at Dev Academy by collaborating effectively with others, improving my communication skills, and engaging in group projects. Additionally, I recognize the importance of soft skills such as empathy, adaptability, and problem-solving, and plan to take advantage of any training provided by Dev Academy to develop these skills. I believe that developing both technical and non-technical skills will be essential for my future success as a developer.
        <p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>My expectations from the Bootcamp team are to guide and support me through the program to become a qualified junior developer. I hope to learn the necessary technical skills, receive valuable feedback on my progress, and gain industry insights and knowledge from experienced instructors. Ultimately, I would like to secure a job in the tech industry, and I believe that the Bootcamp team can help me achieve this goal by providing me with the resources, mentorship, and guidance I need to succeed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>My expectations of myself during Bootcamp are to work hard and focus on becoming a qualified junior developer. I want to fully engage in the program, learn as much as I can, and take advantage of any opportunities for growth and development. Ultimately, my goal is to secure a job in the tech industry, and I'm committed to doing whatever it takes to achieve this goal, including putting in extra time and effort to master the technical skills required for success.</p>

        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
        <p>Firstly, I will respect everyone's opinion and then I will keep my promise to complete my tasks when they are assigned to me. I will also update my progress with other learners regularly and communicate actively to improve my efficiency.</p>

        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>If it takes me more than one hour to solve the problem on my own via google and I can't get a solution by asking my home cohort in Discord, I will ask my facilitators to help me solve the problem immediately.</p>
