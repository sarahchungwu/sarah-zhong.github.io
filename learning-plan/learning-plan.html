        <h2>My learning Plan</h2>
        <br>
        <p>1.What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <p>My long-term plan is to get started in programming through bootcamp and then have more opportunities to access and use programming after I get a job as a developer, which will give me more opportunities to access machine learning and AI development.   
        </p>
        <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
        <p>My strengths are that I am a very good learner and can learn something new very quickly, and I am creative. But my limitation is that I am not very good at allocating time, and then I may not be able to speak English as well as the locals, which may affect my speed and efficiency a bit.</p>

        <p>3.What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
        <p>   I will be looking forward to improving my teamwork skills and my soft skills.
        <p>

        <p>4.A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
        <p>Firstly, I will respect everyone's opinion and then I will keep my promise to complete my tasks when they are assigned to me. I will also update my progress with other learners regularly and communicate actively to improve my efficiency.</p>

        <p>5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
        <p>If it takes me more than one hour to solve the problem on my own via google and I can't get a solution by asking my home cohort in Discord, I will ask my facilitators to help me solve the problem immediately.</p>

        <p>6.A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        <p>I will still need help with my English language skills and may need our facilitators to slow down a little in their discussions at times. Including when I encounter words that I don't understand, I might need facilitators to be a bit more patient.</p>
