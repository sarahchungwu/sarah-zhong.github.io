      <p>1.Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p> 
      <p>  When I used to run a business with my sister, we had a situation where I made a mistake in the operation that could have resulted in the loss of our goods. I could have hidden this from my sister, as I found out later that this issue did not present any problems for our goods. But after much thought, I decided to tell my sister. Because we were a team, we needed to be honest with each other. She has the right to know about this error so we can avoid the next one. Throughout the whole thing, I made the right decision because when I work in a team, I need to be honest with my team, and I also need to put the team's needs first.</p>

      <p>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <p>My family has been a significant influence on me. They have influenced how I deal with people, which is to respect everyone's point of view, acknowledge everyone's contribution and then learn to treat everyone equally.</p>

      <p>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</p>
      <p>I am a very good learner and good at googling information, so I can quickly learn new things.I also enjoy sharing my learning with people and being helpful, which helps me learn as it is a learning process for me when I teach others or ask for help.</p>

      <p>4.Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</p>
      <p>My biggest limitation is my ability to express myself in English, which will also affect my learning ability at a slightly slower pace. It also slightly affects my ability to express my ideas more accurately during my career. I will try to overcome these problems.</p>
      <p>5.Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
      <p>We were under much pressure when I started a business with my sister in my previous job. Still, we needed to go and boost our productivity, so we stopped all our work later on, went out for a break and then returned to a better working conditions.With my current strategy, I'll have regular breaks within 2 hours to refresh ourselves. This short break will also affect the work effect.</p>
