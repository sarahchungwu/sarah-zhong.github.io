    <h1>My problem solving blog</h1>
    <h2>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
    <p>I encountered a small issue on my website where I wanted to remove underlines from some of the links. Initially, I wasn't sure how to go about it, but after doing some research, I discovered that the underlines were the default setting for links added to a website. To fix the issue, I had to write a piece of code that specifically targeted the links I wanted to modify. Following a tutorial I found through googling, I wrote the code and tested it. When I saw that the underlines had disappeared, I felt a great sense of achievement and satisfaction. This experience taught me the importance of taking my time when solving problems and not rushing to seek help. By being patient and methodical, I was able to develop my problem-solving skills and become more confident in my ability to tackle challenges on my own.

    <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
    <p>I recently encountered a problem with my website layout that left me unsure of how to apply flexbox. To resolve this, I realized I needed to do some research and learn more about this technique. I began by searching for tutorials and guides on using flexbox and practiced applying it to simple examples. This helped me gain confidence and a better understanding of the concept. Next, I experimented with different flexbox properties in a new file, using trial and error until I achieved the desired layout. I enjoyed the learning process and became more familiar with flexbox, which proved useful for other web layouts. This experience taught me the importance of hands-on experience when building websites and the value of combining theory with practice to master new techniques.</p>

    <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p>Reflecting on using pseudocode for problem-solving, I found it to be valuable for breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks. Using pseudocode allowed me to organise my thoughts and develop a clear plan before writing actual code.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p>I'm confident in trying new approaches to problem-solving, and I find it useful. Persistence and experimentation often lead to unexpected solutions and growth.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p>I'm still working on using the Rubber Ducky method with confidence, but I believe it could be a valuable approach for problem-solving. I'm eager to continue learning and improving my skills in this area.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
    <p>When it comes to reading error messages, I have become more confident over time. This skill has proven to be very helpful in identifying and solving problems with my code.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p>I have been using console.log more and more frequently in my coding journey, and it is a very helpful tool. At first, I was not very confident in using it, but as I've practised, I've become more familiar with its features and functions. Now, when I encounter an issue in my code, I often turn to console.log to help me find the root of the problem. Printing specific values and seeing the output in the console has been invaluable in helping me debug my code.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p>I find myself quite comfortable with using Google as a problem-solving technique. I have developed a strong proficiency in formulating precise queries and utilising the search engine to identify and obtain relevant information. Through practice and experience, I have learned to refine my search terms and navigate through search results more efficiently. As such, I believe that Google is a very effective tool for problem-solving and has helped me resolve a wide range of issues.

    <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
    <p>Honestly, I find myself hesitant to ask my peers for help as I tend to be a bit shy. However, I understand the value of seeking the input and insights of others, so I am working on improving my confidence in using this problem-solving method.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
    <p>The same issue as above.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
    <p>I am becoming increasingly confident in using reflection as a problem-solving tool. Nowadays, I try to document the problems I encounter, the steps I take to address them, and how I ultimately solve them. Reviewing these notes later on is extremely helpful in identifying patterns and refining my approach to problem-solving.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h2>
    <p>There was a time when I was reluctant to ask for help when I was working on the javascript test. I got stuck on an issue, but it was during the weekendend, and I didn't think it was a good time to seek help. I had poor time management, so I had to spend the weekendend finishing the task. Therefore, I hesitated to ask for help because I didn't want to disturb anyone during their time off. However, I realized that asking for help is a crucial part of problem-solving, and it is better to reach out to someone rather than struggle alone.</p>
