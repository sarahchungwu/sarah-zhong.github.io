    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>EQ (Emotional Intelligence) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) are different in that they measure different types of intelligence. IQ measures cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, logic, and critical thinking. EQ, on the other hand, measures emotional and social intelligence, such as empathy, self-awareness, and the ability to manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>EQ is important because it helps us navigate the social and emotional aspects of life. When we have high EQ, we are better able to recognize and manage our own emotions, which can lead to better decision-making, healthier relationships, and a more positive outlook on life. EQ also helps us understand the emotions of others and respond to them in an appropriate and compassionate way. This can lead to better communication, stronger relationships, and a more harmonious work or home environment.</p>
