    <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>Cooking a meal is like building a website. Just as cooking involves different ingredients and techniques, building a website involves different technologies.

    HTML is like the main ingredient of a dish, such as pasta in a spaghetti dish or rice in a stir fry. It's the foundation of the dish, just as HTML is the foundation of a website. HTML provides the structure and content of the website, just as pasta or rice provides the base of a dish.
      
    CSS is like the seasoning and garnish of a dish, such as salt, pepper, and fresh herbs. It's what makes the dish visually appealing, just as CSS makes a website visually appealing by providing the colours, fonts, and layout.
      
    JavaScript is like the technique used to cook the dish, such as grilling, roasting, or saut√©ing. It's what makes the dish come to life, just as JavaScript brings interactivity and functionality to a website.
      
    Therefore a delicious meal requires all the ingredients and cooking techniques to come together, and a well-designed website requires all three technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - to create a great user experience.</p>

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those)</h2>
    <p>Control flow is like the order of steps we need to take to make breakfast. For example, we might start by putting a pan on the stove to heat up, then cracking some eggs into the pan, and then adding salt and pepper. The steps have to be done in a specific order to make sure that the eggs cook properly and the seasoning is evenly distributed.
    Loops, on the other hand, are like doing a repetitive task. For example, if we were making pancakes, we might pour batter onto a hot griddle and then wait for the bubbles to form before flipping the pancake over. We would repeat this process for each pancake we want to make.</p>

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
    <p>The DOM is like a magic tool that lets web developers change what a webpage looks like and does. As a user, you might see this when you click a button on a website and something changes on the page, like a message appears or a picture shows up. All of this happens through the DOM, which is what makes websites interactive and cool!</p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
    <p>Arrays are like grocery lists where we access items by position, while objects are like wallets where were access items by their label or name.. For example, if we want to get the third item on a grocery list, you would look at the thing in the third position on the list. An object, on the other hand, is like a wallet that contains different types of things, such as money, credit cards, and ID cards.For example, if we wanted to get the phone number from a friend's contact card in our wallet, we would look for the label that says "phone number" and then read the number that's next to it.</p>

    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
    <p>Think of a function like a fishing lure. Just as a lure is a tool that helps you catch fish, a function is a tool that helps you write better code. It's like having a favorite fishing lure that you use to catch fish in different bodies of water - you don't have to start from scratch every time you fish in a new spot, you can just use the same lure and catch fish more efficiently.</p>
