    <h1>My Foundations Reflections</h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p>The core learning activities have taught me several valuable lessons about myself and my ego. Firstly, I have learned how to think like a web developer, which has been crucial as I transition into a new career. This skill has helped me to approach problems systematically, think critically, and write efficient and effective code.Secondly, I have discovered the importance of emotional intelligence and how it can positively impact my interactions with others in the workplace. Through various exercises and self-reflection, I have learned to identify my own emotions and those of others, and how to respond appropriately. I believe that this newfound awareness will help me to communicate better, build stronger relationships, and be a more effective team player.Lastly, I have learned about the power of a growth mindset and the benefits of constantly seeking to learn and improve. By adopting a growth mindset, I am more open to challenges, more resilient in the face of setbacks, and more motivated to strive for success. This mindset has already helped me to approach my learning with more enthusiasm and determination, and I believe it will continue to serve me well in my future endeavours.

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are essential for learning and programming. They help us make ethical decisions, understand the needs of others, and improve our personal and professional growth. In programming, collaboration and problem-solving require strong teamwork skills, which can be enhanced by values and empathy. Additionally, self-awareness can help us identify our areas of weakness, improve our skills, and keep learning.</p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>I was most surprised by the concept of neuroplasticity and the power of a growth mindset in the core learning. It was eye-opening to learn how our brains can change and adapt through new experiences and learning, and how this can impact our success in coding and other areas of life. Additionally, the idea of a growth mindset - that we can constantly improve our abilities through effort and persistence - was empowering and motivating. It has helped me to approach challenges with a more positive and open mindset, and to believe in my ability to learn and succeed in my coding journey.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me was creating and implementing an effective learning plan. It required me to be self-directed, disciplined, and organized in setting goals and tracking progress. It also required me to be flexible and adapt my plan as I encountered new challenges or opportunities. Despite the challenge, I found that the process of creating and implementing a learning plan was valuable in helping me identify my strengths and weaknesses, set priorities, and achieve my learning goals.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, the programming school is focusing on core learning in the web development Bootcamp course because it recognizes the importance of developing well-rounded and effective programmers. Technical skills alone are not enough to succeed in the industry; soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are essential to be a successful programmer. By dedicating time and resources to core learning, the school is preparing its students not only to write good code but also to work effectively in a team, communicate with clients, and continue learning and growing throughout their careers.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>I don't feel that the time I spent studying core learning was a waste. In fact, I think it was necessary to reflect on how to improve my overall capacity as a programmer. The soft skills and personal growth that I have gained through the core learning activities are essential for success in any career, including web development. Moreover, the balance between the technical and non-technical aspects of the Bootcamp course has been appropriate and valuable for me.</p>
